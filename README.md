# Volume Widget

Provides a simple volume widget for the Awesome window manager. It displays the
current volume with an icon and allows you to adjust the volume when you press
the volume up and down buttons on your keyboard, if you have them.

This widget has been tested on awesome v4.1.

### Dependencies

No extra Awesome libraries are required, but the widget uses the
`amixer` command for ALSA, or `pactl` for PulseAudio.

### Setup

1. Navigate to your Awesome config directory (usually `~/.config/awesome`) and
   clone this repository with the following command:

	```
	git clone https://github.com/velovix/awesome.volume-widget
	```

2. Create a symlink for the volume-widget.lua file. This is done so that
   your rc.lua can find the code, and so you can update the widget by simply
   pulling in changes from this repository later. While still in the Awesome
   config directory, run the following:

	```
	ln -s $(pwd)awesome.volume-widget/volume-widget.lua volume-widget.lua
	```

3. In your rc.lua, add the following near the beginning of the file. This loads
   up the library and has you access it through the new `volume_widget` table
   we're creating.

	```
	local volume_widget = require("volume-widget")
	```

4. Add the following line near the beginning of your rc.lua, but after the line
   in the previous step. Providing an empty table sets all configurations to
   their defaults. See the configuration section for details, especially if you
   use Pulse Audio.

	```
	local volume = volume_widget:new({})
	```

5. Add the following lines near where other similar key bindings are being made
   in the rc.lua. This will allow you to control volume with your
   volume keys on your keyboard.

	```
	awful.key({}, "XF86AudioRaiseVolume", function() volume:down() end),
	awful.key({}, "XF86AudioLowerVolume", function() volume:up() end),
	```

6. Finally, to add your widget to the bar, you'll have to add the following
   line somewhere after the `right_layout` table is created.

	```
	right_layout:add(volume.widget)
	```

7. Restart Awesome WM and you're finished! You should see a white volume
   icon on the top right of the screen!

### Configuration

The default configuration is probably fine for ALSA users, but if you use
PulseAudio you will have to do some configuration. Feed configuration options
into the `new` function instead of the default empty table.

- **backend**: As of now, `alsa` and `pulseaudio` are the supported backends.
- **step**: The amount that the volume should be incremented or decremented.
  The default is `5`.
- **device**: The device to control. The default is "Master", which will work
  for ALSA but not PulseAudio. When using PulseAudio, "devices" in this case
  refer to "sinks", which are represented by indexes. You probably want 0 as
  your device. You can take a look at your available sinks with `pacmd
  list-sinks`.

The following is an example configuration:

```
local volume = volume_widget:new({
    backend="pulseaudio",
    device=0,
    step=2})
```
